One thing I wish I knew before coming to UMBC is the abundance of research opportunities that can greatly accelerate my career. Through engaging in research projects, I could gain valuable hands-on experience, establish connections with faculty mentors, and enhance my critical thinking skills.
Start with a random assignment of colors to each vertex using three colors.
Repeat the following process for a certain number of iterations:
For each vertex, consider the color assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied edges.
Update the color assignment of each vertex based on the selected maximization.
Output the final color assignment.
The randomized nature of the algorithm allows it to explore different color assignments and iteratively improve the number of satisfied edges. On average, the algorithm is expected to achieve a solution that satisfies at least 1.5 times the number of edges as an optimal 3-coloring would.

Analysis of the expected number of edges that are satisfied by your algorithm:

Let OPT be the maximum number of edges that can be satisfied in an optimal 3-coloring.
Let SAT be the number of satisfied edges achieved by our algorithm.
The algorithm guarantees an expected approximation ratio of 1.5, meaning SAT ≥ (3/2) * OPT.
The analysis of the expected number of satisfied edges considers the probability of each edge being satisfied during the random assignment process and the subsequent iterations of updating the color assignments.

the analysis of the expected number of satisfied edges by the algorithm, it involves considering the probabilities of each edge being satisfied during the random assignment process and the subsequent iterations of updating the color assignments.

Specifically, we can analyze the expected number of satisfied edges by considering the probability of each edge being satisfied at each step of the algorithm. By calculating the probabilities of satisfaction for all edges and summing them up, we can estimate the expected number of edges that will be satisfied by the algorithm.
For each edge in the graph, determine the probability of it being satisfied under the random assignment. This probability depends on the current color assignments of the vertices connected by the edge.

State and briefly justify the running time of your algorithm:

The running time of the algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
Assigning colors to each vertex takes O(V) time, as we need to visit each vertex once.
The iterative process involves considering the color assignment for each vertex and updating them based on maximizing the number of satisfied edges. Since we need to consider each edge once, this step takes O(E) time.
Therefore, the overall running time of the algorithm is O(V + E), as the time complexities of the individual steps are added together.
The algorithm achieves an expected approximation ratio of 1.5 by iteratively improving the number of satisfied edges through randomized color assignments and updates. The running time of the algorithm is proportional to the number of vertices and edges in the graph (O(V + E)).



we see 4.3 and see the average PD its decreasing so thats y we are doing velocity for the pupil diameter and expalimn how we are calculating it i.e time 1.0. we normalize pupil diameter from the initial pupild diameter thats y it comes negative value.magnify dip

The motivation for the pupil diameter velocity is to find the effective cognitive load when the pupil diameter is undergoing a particular task i.e. right cognitive load which changes pupil diameter under the various task which we have as cognitive load. To find the cognitive load, derivative of pupil diameter velocity will enhance the occurance of cognitive load and we can have clear idea when there is load on pupil for the tasks. The plot of the graph is for pupil diameter velocity, pupil diameter versus time. We analyse by plotting derivative of pupil diameter and by plotting pupil diameter and see how the stimulus time is plotted there because that stimulus time detects the cognitive load on pupil diameter fo given task. The derivative of pupil dimeter velocity gives broader picture to detect the cognitive load.
As seen in the plot for VWM task, as plot decreases at stimulus time for pupil diameter, the derivative of pupil diameter velocity decreases further. And based of this derivative we can say that whenever derivative changes drastically(at stimulus time) we have cognitive load there. With this plot we can detect the cognitive load.
Whereas in the plot for MA task, there are outliers in the plot. The correct decrement is not there as every single drop for pupil diameter, reduces drastically. so sometimes at that drop there is no cognitive load. Further analysis done on data and came to know that MA has missing data, therefore the derivative graph behaved like that. One way is to look at what correct velocity will give the right prediction of cognitive load there.

From section 4.3, we see the constriction in PD at the initial ST. We want to magnify that constriction in PD, the derivative of PD gives us the magnified constriction in PD.

From section 4.3, we see the constriction in PD at the initial ST. We want to magnify that constriction in PD, the derivative of PD gives us the magnified constriction in PD. The constriction in PD is because of the cognitive load. To find the cognitive load, derivative of pupil diameter magnifies the constriction in PD. The plot of the graph is for pupil diameter velocity, pupil diameter versus time. For the plot we normalize the PD by subtracting the initial PD with each PD. We calculate derivative of PD as difference of the PD upon time intervals of those PD considered. Not all the PD or Time is plotted as the plot will not be easy to analyse, so we consider 5000 samples. The difference of 2 consecutive time intervals of PD are 0.004s. We can select any of the time intervals like 0.004,0.08,0.1,1,.. for the derivative. For the difference of 0.004 we can not analyze the plot properly for ST. We should consider a good time interval difference, not too high nor too low. For VWM task I have considered time of 1s and for MA 0.1s/0.2s gave clear plot rather than 1s.
As seen in the plot for VWM task, as plot decreases at stimulus time for pupil diameter i.e. contriction in PD, the derivative of pupil diameter velocity magnifies the decrease.

During my previous role as a Programmer Analyst at Cognizant, we as a team encountered a situation where I received negative feedback on a project I was working on. The feedback highlighted some areas where the application I developed fell short of the client's expectations. Initially, I felt disappointed, but I understood the importance of using feedback as an opportunity for growth.

We overcame by condcucting customer review on the application to detect the flaws and conducted surveys within our team about the application

During a project at our undergraduate school, I received negative feedback on my project work, as it did not meet the faculty's expectations. To overcome this, I reflected on the feedback, sought additional input from students outside our team, conducted surveys, and analyzed the findings of our limitation. Based on the feedback, we implemented improvements and showcased our progress to the faculty. This experience taught me the importance of embracing feedback for personal growth and continuously improving my work.




During a project at our undergraduate school, I took on the role of a team leader, responsible for designing and developing the application. One of the challenges I faced was effectively assigning tasks according to each team member's skills and capabilities. However, I enjoyed the collaborative nature of the project, as it allowed me to facilitate brainstorming sessions and witness the collective efforts of the team coming together to achieve a successful outcome. I enjoyed generating new ideas from these collaborative sessions. This experience highlighted the significance of teamwork, effective communication, and individual strengths to accomplish a shared objective.


I have taken 2 of my favourite cources Algorithms, MAchine Learning . First of all both are mandatory courses to complete besides that i have interest in coding and mathematics. I am passionate about these courses. Coming to the third subject,Computer security i selected that because of out of choice coz all other classes were filled, i wanted to take Computer graphics
